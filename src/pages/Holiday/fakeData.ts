It passes through the Vila Nova de Gaia region near Porto, an area famed for its production of the fortified wine, Port.

This activity is all about teamwork and working in tandem to move the boat in the right direction. There is an optional visit to Port Wine and Caves Ferreira, where you will discover the traditional production and storage of fortified wine. You will spend a total of two hours 30 minutes sailing on the Douro. An extra hour should be counted if you choose the wine visit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConditions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E The sailing boat used for this activity is a Beneteau Platu 25. It is 7.5 metres long with a 2.5-metre width. This vessel has a maximum capacity of six including the skipper. The waters of the Douro River are relatively calm, with winds often creating moderate swell making it suitable for beginners. This part of the Douro river features only small boats and vessels, creating very little traffic and larger margins for manoeuvring.\u003C/p\u003E"
